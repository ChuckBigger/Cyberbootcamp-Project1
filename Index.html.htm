<p class=MsoNormal>            Let's start with an introduction.  I am a
retired Navy Senior Chief who has been on a cybersecurity journey since high
school.  I developed this blog to help</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            other people who are interested about
cybersecurity to have a space to share knowledge and develop their passions
together in a safe space!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It is my vision to create a page that contains
current cyber issues, resource links, as well as tips for people looking to
start their own cyber-journey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &lt;h3&gt;Beware of Free Wi-Fi&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &lt;h4&gt;Emotet, Wi-Fi, Worm&lt;/h4&gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &lt;p&gt;     We live in a world where
wireless devices are everywhere and are providing an unprecedented level of
convenience in our lives both at work and at home.  However, the convenience of
a wireless network can become a security threat if not properly protected. 
With all the passwords that we must use throughout our daily lives it is easy
to relax our guard when setting up passwords on our personal devices and
networks which can have devastating results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Researchers have discovered a variation of the
malware loader Emotet that has been specifically designed to spread to any
nearby Wi-Fi networks protected by weak passwords.  Upon startup of Worm.exe,
it first copies the service.exe string to a variable that will be used during
file spreading and then immediately begins profiling the wireless network using
wlanAPI.dll calls in order to spread to any networks it can access.  The
wlanAPI.dll is one of the primary libraries used in wireless networks to manage
wireless network profiles and communications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>        The malware uses brute force algorithms to attempt
to breach the password for the target Wi-Fi network.  Once it has gained access
it searches for non-hidden shares including the administrator accounts and
proceeds to attempt to brute force those accounts.  Once it has gained access
to individual user accounts it executes the service.exe binary which installs
the Windows Defender System Service to gain persistence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>        Although researchers have recently discovered this
malware the timestamp on the worm.exe code is 4/16/2018 which means that it may
have been circulating unnoticed for two years.  Part of this subversion is the
fact that if researchers do not have a Wi-Fi card in their sandbox environment
it would not show up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>        However, it is defensible with strong password
schemes that have proven to be effective against brute force algorithms.  Also,
detection strategies including active monitoring of endpoints for new services
being installed and investigating suspicious services or any processes running
from temporary folders and user profile application data folders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &lt;h3&gt;Are Smart Speakers Putting Your
Data at Risk!&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &lt;h4&gt;Alexa, Google, Smart
Speakers&lt;/h4&gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &lt;p&gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                    The mobile technology I would like to
discuss are smart speakers.  These technologies are exciting, convenient, and
affordable.  A few short years ago technology that could “listen” for your
commands and respond was something seen in a science fiction movie, now they
seem to be everywhere and are being incorporated not more and more devices
every year.  As of December 2018 there were 118.5 million smart speakers in
American homes with 52 percent of those homes having two or more devices. 
While these devices are easy to set-up and use, they represent several
challenges: how is they data collected being used, are they fallible, and can
they be hacked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>        The first challenge that I present is with an
“always on” system how much of what we say in its vicinity is being captured by
the device and then later analyzed by the manufacturers, such as Google and
Amazon?  Both companies openly admit that their devices are always tuned in. 
If everything is working as it is supposed to, unless someone speaks that
devices “wake word” the device clears its memory every few seconds.  However
once the “wake word” is spoken and responded to a stream of audio is sent to
the company’s servers for analysis and stored indefinitely.  Google states that
it uses data collected by Google Home to make its services “faster, smarter,
more relevant, and more useful” and to provide “better and more personalized
suggestions and answers.”, while Amazon states that voice recordings are used
to “improve your experience and our services” and “make recommendations to you
based on your requests”.  This would explain why ads seen in google chrome or
on amazon seem to “know” exactly what has been most recently on your mind. 
This is Big Data at work and the amount of information being collected on
consumers is staggering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This has been documented as a flawed system.  In 2018, a
woman by the name of Danielle states that her Amazon Alexa Echo not only
recorded her private conversation but sent a recording to one of her husband’s
colleagues who lives 176 miles away.  After contacting Amazon, a technician
confirmed that the Alexa device had recorded and sent the message.  According
to the technician, “Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation
sounding like ‘Alexa.’ Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a ‘send
message’ request. At which point, Alexa said out loud ‘To whom?’ At this point,
the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customer’s contact
list. Alexa then asked out loud, ‘[contact name], right?’ Alexa then
interpreted the background conversation as ‘right’. As unlikely as this string
of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely.” 
We will never know whether or not this is what really happened, but the fact
that it did happen should make everyone who owns a device like this wary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>        The next challenge that I would like to discuss is,
can these devices be hacked?  The simple answer is yes.  Security researchers
at SRLabs have successfully shown how these devices can be turned into
eavesdropping tools or can even be used in a phishing attack.  The researchers
used third-party skills/actions, depending on the device, to extend the
microphone listening time after completing a simple task, such as generating a
random number or giving a horoscope.  These devices can be turned into phishing
devices by the hacker manipulating them into issuing a fake error message that
asks the user for their password.  Even though Google and Amazon vet and
approve every third-party application there is no process for validating
updates to existing apps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>        Tips for protecting yourself against these devices
being hacked are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•       Watch what you connect to the devices.  Obviously,
you would not want to connect security functions such as door locks or security
cameras.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•       Routinely delete commands to remove any sensitive
information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•       Be careful what is shared with the devices.  Do not
share passwords, credit card info, or social security numbers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•       Simply turn off the microphone when not in use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•       Pay attention to notification emails.  This could
alert you to inadvertent orders or perhaps suspicious activity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•       Turn off “personal results” feature. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•       Use a WPA2 encrypted network and not an open
hotspot.  Additionally, create a guest network for visitors to connect to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•       Enable voice recognition. While not always
successful this feature might help prevent unauthorized users.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•       Last but not least strengthen your passwords and
whenever possible use two-factor authentication. </p>
